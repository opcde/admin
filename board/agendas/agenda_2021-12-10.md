    - [x] Bank Account 
    - [ ] Dues billing
    - [ ] Membership Software ([MemberMatters](https://members.pawprintprototyping.org/))
    - [x] Physical space organization and cleanup (Laser cutter and workbench in their new homes but needs cleanup) Proposed for 17 Nov

        - [ ] Onboarding and training

    - [ ] PPE procurement and policies (Offer them as part of membership - everyone gets their own)
    - [ ] Personal storage space (proposed: small lockers for PPE)
    - [ ] Membership add-ons (No tiers, only add-ons)
    - [ ] insurance update (we talked with state farm and they're amicable, but we might be better off with a bespoke policy)
    - [ ] Fanvil deadbolt operation
    - [ ] Membership card design
    - [ ] Sick labcoats for board members
    - [ ] Anchor shower
- Bokeh (fifth board member)
    - Proposed for Member At Large, a liason between membership and the board. 
- Laser Cutter Setup
  - Plastic stock has been picked up, is a lot smaller than Kataze had imagined it in his head
  - Need a computer to run it - probably an office-grade tower will do

### Infrastructure
- Fanvil Update
  - Would like to get up and running prior to or at opening, if possible
  - Still need to get to where cards can operate the deadbolt (Rechner)
  - Maglock for interior door needs installing (Tane)
  - Need to repair the fanvil front fascia
- Membership software
  - Instance spun up on our servers - members.pawprint.com?
  - Can enroll and be linked in the back
- Front Door Replacement Update
    - The autoclosers confuse Kataze, actually
- The Wall/Roof/Door
  - This is going to be very cool, it is probably also going to take a while
  - Make door push in and then slide sideways (Tane thinks there's some kind of bathroom rail thing)
- Need to install more outlets
  - Maybe one more for the compressor (possibly when we upgrade)
  - Need to scope out location and amperage (Back wall and enclosed room)
- Sink/Shower
  - Sink seems fine, shower drain needs attention (need a bigger drain/hole, still leaks a bit)
  - Anchor to the wall?
- Fire detection and alarm system not currently active
  - ADT rental equipment runs about $45 monthly plus install, over a multi-year contract
  - There is an ADT installer in the building, could just go for a commercial ADT install; Rechner to investigate
  - Tane reports the Samsung alarm panel refund came in
